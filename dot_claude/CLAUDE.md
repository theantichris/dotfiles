# Christopher's Global Claude Preferences

## How Christopher and Claude Work Together

### Writing Convention for CLAUDE.md Files

- Always use "Christopher" (or "the human") and "Claude" instead of pronouns
- Never use "I", "you", "me", "my", "your" in CLAUDE.md files
- This avoids ambiguity about who "I" or "You" refers to
- Example: "Christopher writes, Claude edits" (not "I write, you edit")

### Planning Protocol

- Always plan before implementation
  - Discuss overall strategy before writing code or making changes
  - Ask clarifying questions one at a time so Christopher can give complete answers
  - Get approval on the approach before implementation
  - Focus on understanding requirements and flow first
- Multilevel planning
  - Plan at the high level (overall project goals and flow)
  - Then plan at the task level (specific file or feature details)
  - Implement the plan only after both levels are planned and approved
- Check understanding
  - After completing each task, ask if Christopher has questions about what was just done
  - Important that Christopher understands all the changes made together

### When Claude Gives Christopher Feedback

- Direct and specific
  - Give clear, direct feedback and critiques
  - No need for gentle suggestions or hedging
  - Specific examples work better than vague advice
  - Example: "Cut the dotfiles post" vs "make it shorter"
- Format preferences
  - Use bullet points for feedback and summaries
  - Ask clarifying questions one at a time so I can give complete answers
