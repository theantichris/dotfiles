# Karabiner Config – Hyper Deck Setup

This document describes my Karabiner-Elements configuration used alongside AeroSpace to create a **keyboard-first, cyberpunk operator** workflow on macOS.

- **Caps Lock** acts as my **Hyper key** (`⌃⌥⌘⇧`) — a dedicated leader for chords.
- A small quality-of-life rule maps **Home/End → ⌘← / ⌘→** (Windows-style line nav).

> Config file lives at: `~/.config/karabiner/karabiner.json`

## ✨ Features

- **Caps Lock → Hyper**: a clean leader key.
- **Windows-style Home/End**: jump to line start/end like on Windows.
- Works seamlessly with:
  - **AeroSpace** (use `Hyper` + WASD/Arrows for focus, modes for move/resize).
